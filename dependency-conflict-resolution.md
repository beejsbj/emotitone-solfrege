# Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue
The Vercel build was failing with a dependency conflict error:

```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error While resolving: pinia-plugin-persistedstate@4.4.1
npm error Found: pinia@2.3.1
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peerOptional pinia@">=3.0.0" from pinia-plugin-persistedstate@4.4.1
```

## Root Cause
- The project was using `pinia@^2.1.7` (which resolved to version 2.3.1)
- The `pinia-plugin-persistedstate@^4.4.0` package requires `pinia@>=3.0.0`
- This created a peer dependency conflict

## Solution
Updated the `package.json` to use compatible versions:

### Before:
```json
"pinia": "^2.1.7"
```

### After:
```json
"pinia": "^3.0.3"
```

## Actions Taken
1. Updated `pinia` version from `^2.1.7` to `^3.0.3` in `package.json`
2. Deleted `package-lock.json` to force regeneration with correct dependencies
3. Verified the pinia setup in `src/main.ts` is compatible with version 3.x
4. Confirmed successful installation with `npm install`
5. Verified successful build with `npm run build`

## Result
- ✅ Dependencies install without conflicts
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes required in application code
- ✅ Pinia 3.x is fully compatible with existing store implementations

## Notes
- Pinia 3.x maintains backward compatibility with existing store definitions
- No changes were needed to the existing pinia stores or setup code
- The upgrade resolves the dependency conflict while maintaining full functionality
