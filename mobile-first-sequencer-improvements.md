# Mobile-First Circular Sequencer Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Finicky Hitboxes** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Hit detection was inconsistent and unreliable
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased track stroke width from 6px to 12px (16px on hover, 20px when active)
  - Enlarged indicator hit areas from ±12px to ±18px around track radius
  - Improved touch target sizes for mobile devices

### 2. **Complex Drag Interactions** ✅ REDESIGNED  
- **Problem**: Separate drag modes for moving and resizing were confusing
- **Solution**: New unified drag model
  - **Horizontal drag**: Move beat along track (left/right)
  - **Vertical drag**: Change beat duration (up = longer, down = shorter)
  - **Double-tap**: Delete beat
  - Removed complex drag handles entirely

### 3. **Mobile Oval Shape** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: SVG was becoming oval-shaped on mobile devices
- **Solution**: 
  - Responsive container sizing: `min(90vw, 90vh, 400px)` for both width and height
  - Maintains perfect square aspect ratio on all devices
  - Removed fixed width/height attributes from SVG

### 4. **Mobile-First Design** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Touch-optimized interactions**:
  - Larger touch targets (12px+ stroke widths)
  - Improved sensitivity settings (0.8 for position, 0.02 for duration)
  - Better visual feedback with glowing effects during interactions
- **Responsive sizing**:
  - Uses viewport dimensions but caps at reasonable desktop size
  - Perfect circles on all screen sizes and orientations

## New Interaction Model

### Creating Beats
```
Tap empty track space → Creates new beat at snapped position
```

### Moving Beats  
```
Drag horizontally ← → Moves beat around the track
```

### Resizing Beats
```
Drag vertically ↑ ↓ Changes beat duration (up = longer)
```

### Deleting Beats
```
Double-tap beat → Removes beat with haptic feedback
```

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Stroke widths**: 12px → 16px → 20px (normal → hover → active)
- **Glow effects**: Drop shadows on selected (12px) and dragging (16px) states
- **Smooth transitions**: 0.2s cubic-bezier for all state changes

### Better Touch Detection
- **Movement threshold**: 10px before marking as "moved" (prevents accidental drags)
- **Double-tap timing**: 300ms window for double-tap detection
- **Directional priority**: Compares deltaX vs deltaY to determine interaction type

### Responsive Container
```css
.circular-sequencer-container {
  width: min(90vw, 90vh, 400px);
  height: min(90vw, 90vh, 400px);
}
```

### Mobile-Optimized Sensitivity
- **Position movement**: 0.8 sensitivity (was 0.5)
- **Duration change**: 0.02 sensitivity (was 0.01)
- **Movement detection**: 10px threshold for reliable touch/mouse differentiation

## Benefits

1. **Intuitive**: Single drag model that feels natural on mobile
2. **Reliable**: Large hit areas prevent missed taps
3. **Responsive**: Perfect circles on all devices and orientations
4. **Accessible**: Clear visual feedback and haptic responses
5. **Fast**: Immediate response with smooth animations

## Usage

The improved sequencer maintains the same API but provides much better mobile UX:

```vue
<ImprovedCircularSequencer />
```

**Key interaction changes:**
- No more separate drag handles
- Horizontal/vertical drag directions have distinct functions
- Double-tap replaces double-click for mobile compatibility
- Larger touch targets throughout

The sequencer now works excellently on both mobile and desktop with consistent, predictable interactions that follow mobile-first design principles.
