# Hilbert Scope Testing Guide

## Implementation Complete!

The Hilbert Scope feature has been successfully implemented into the EmotiTone Solfège unified visual effects system.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Enable Hilbert Scope:**
   - The Hilbert Scope starts disabled by default (as configured)
   - You'll need to enable it through the visual configuration:
     - Open the AutoDebugPanel (if available)
     - Navigate to Visual Effects → Hilbert Scope
     - Toggle "isEnabled" to true

3. **What to expect:**
   - A single circular, oscillating visualization in the top center of the screen
   - White color by default (can be changed to amplitude-based coloring)
   - Trail effect creating smooth, organic movements
   - Responds to ALL audio output (not per-note like blobs)

4. **Configuration options to test:**
   - `isEnabled`: Toggle on/off
   - `sizeRatio`: Adjust overall size (0.1 to 0.5 recommended)
   - `opacity`: Visibility level
   - `history`: Trail strength (0 = no trail, 0.95 = long trail)
   - `lineWidth`: Thickness of the scope line
   - `colorMode`: Switch between 'white' and 'amplitude' modes
   - `glowEnabled`: Toggle glow effect
   - `driftSpeed`: How much the scope drifts around

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Hilbert Scope appears when enabled
- [ ] Positioned in top center of screen
- [ ] Responds to audio playback with circular oscillations
- [ ] Trail effect works smoothly
- [ ] Works alongside other effects (blobs, particles, etc.)
- [ ] Properly cleans up when disabled
- [ ] Configuration changes apply in real-time

## Technical Details

- Uses Web Audio API's ConvolverNode for Hilbert transform
- Connected to Tone.js audio output
- Integrated into unified canvas rendering pipeline
- Performance optimized with existing animation loop

## Troubleshooting

If the Hilbert Scope doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure audio context is initialized (play a note first)
3. Verify it's enabled in visual config
4. Check that other visual effects are working

## Notes

- The ESLint errors shown during development are pre-existing configuration issues
- TypeScript compilation passes successfully for all new code
- Implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase
