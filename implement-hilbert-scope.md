Implement Hilbert Scope

here is the fully modular code for the hilbert scope.
@hilbert-scope-tone.html

i want you to implememnt it into the unified visual effects canvas

it would be similar to blobs, but blobs happen for each note. hilbert scope would be just one that reacts to the audio.

it would be in the top half of the screen, in center. would have config too implemented into visualconfig and autodebug, sizeratio, minsize, maxsize, opacity, scale in dur, scale out dur, drift speed, glow enabled, glow intensity.
