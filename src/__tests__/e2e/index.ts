/**
 * 2. Music Learning Workflow (music-learning-workflow.test.ts)
 * - Key and mode changes
 * - Solfège palette interactions
 * - Note playing and audio feedback
 * - Visual feedback coordination
 * - Harmonic analysis and intervals
 * - Touch interactions for mobile
 */

/**
 * 3. Simple Composition Workflow (simple-composition-workflow.test.ts)
 * - Creating beats on sequencer grid
 * - Playback with audio feedback
 * - Pattern modification and editing

 * - Tempo adjustments
 * - Velocity variations and dynamics
 */

/**
 * 4. Advanced Sequencer Usage (advanced-sequencer-usage.test.ts)
 * - Multi-track sequencer management
 * - Different instruments per track
 * - Complex polyrhythmic patterns
 * - Transport controls and global playback
 * - Multi-ring (scale degree) patterns
 * - Simultaneous multi-track playback
 */

/**
 * 5. Project Management (project-management.test.ts)
 * - Project saving with full state persistence
 * - Project loading and state restoration
 * - Multiple project creation and switching
 * - Import/export functionality
 * - Metadata tracking and versioning
 * - Project duplication and validation
 */

/**
 * 6. Performance and Stress Testing (performance-stress.test.ts)
 * - Rapid user interaction handling
 * - Multiple simultaneous audio streams
 * - Complex composition stress tests
 * - Memory usage during extended sessions
 * - Canvas rendering performance
 * - Error recovery under high load
 */

/**
 * 7. Cross-Browser Compatibility (cross-browser-compatibility.test.ts)
 * - Different Web Audio API implementations
 * - Viewport sizes and orientations
 * - Touch event implementations
 * - Canvas context variations
 * - localStorage availability and limitations
 * - Animation frame implementations
 */

// Test Execution Instructions:

/**
 * Running E2E Tests:
 * 
 * 1. Individual test files:
 *    bun run test src/__tests__/e2e/first-time-user.test.ts
 *    bun run test src/__tests__/e2e/music-learning-workflow.test.ts
 *    etc.
 * 
 * 2. All E2E tests:
 *    bun run test src/__tests__/e2e/
 * 
 * 3. With UI for interactive debugging:
 *    bun run test:ui src/__tests__/e2e/
 * 
 * 4. With coverage reporting:
 *    bun run test:coverage src/__tests__/e2e/
 */

// Notes for Developers:

/**
 * When adding new features:
 * 1. Add corresponding E2E tests to relevant test files
 * 2. Update this index with new test categories
 * 3. Ensure tests cover both happy path and error scenarios
 * 4. Include performance considerations for new features
 * 5. Test on mobile-first responsive design
 * 
 * When debugging test failures:
 * 1. Run individual test files to isolate issues
 * 2. Use test:ui for interactive debugging
 * 3. Check console output for mock setup issues
 * 4. Verify timing with waitForAudioLoad/waitForAnimation
 * 5. Review audio context and canvas mocking
